# Home Assistant AddOn for setting max current on ABL EMH1 charger over RS485 MODBUS


Allows you to connect the ABL EMH1 charger over RS485 modbus connection or over a TCP/IP to serial converter* to homeassistant and update the max charging current, read sensors and enable or disable the charger. The RS485 connection typically can happen over a USB or any other serial signal converter enabled over TCP/IP. Be aware that no support can be offered for configuring such a network device. This code will simply transport the Modbus message to a network enabled Modbus device.
This extension is also able to detect if the charger is 16A or 32A ready.


## Installation:
Add the files to your /custom_components/ folder or use the "+" in the integrations tabs

1. Use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download), in `HACS > Integrations > Explore & Add Repositories` search for "ev charger". After adding this `https://github.com/scho0ck/abl_emh1_modbus` as a custom repository, go to 7.
2. If you do not have HACS, use the tool of choice to open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
3. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
4. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `ev_charger_modbus`.
5. Download the files from the `custom_components/ev_charger_modbus/` directory (folder) in this repository.
6. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
7. Restart Home Assistant.
8. Add the integration: [![Add Integration][add-integration-badge]][add-integration] or in the HA UI go to "Settings" -> "Devices & Services" then click "+" and search for "EV charger Modbus".
9. Input the right parameter. Select either the serial device system port or the TCP/IP and then input port or host and port in the suggested format.

and restart home assistant.

## Usage:
You should now be able to have a new device in the integration. From there, you can set the charging rate to 0 or between 5 and 16 Amperes, read the current from the device and completely switch it off and on again.

## How to test:

Find the service and send the update!
Select either 0 Amps or any value between 5 and 16 or 32 depending on your hardware.

A switch has been created and can be found in the entities. This enables disabling the charger or enable the charger if it was previously disabled.
The switch scans the state of the charger to be in the right position.
Disabling the charger and setting to 0 amperes has some nuances where depending on your use case, one is better fitted.

As well, one can set the charging current with the slider. The default value is the max amperes of your hardware. In case of errors, it stays on this maximum, either 16 or 32 amperes.
The charger will only accept values between 5 and 16 or 32 and will stop charging on 0.

*Modbus over Wifi was tested by one contributor with Elfin EW11 RS485 over Wifi. Please avoid creating issue over connection with devices and use discussion topics to discuss with the community.
